Your Black & Yellow Pages sponsor has withdrawn their sponsorship.  This means
the two-way trust relationship between you and your sponsor has been severed.

Your account, trust links, and listings are intact and available for anyone to
display.  Rather than display your sponsor, however, your account is now
listed as a orphan.

As an orphan, you cannot sponsor new agorists or adopt agorists from the
orphanage.  Your account will be listed in the orphanage for other agorists to
adopt.  If an agorist wishes to sponsor you, you will have an opportunity to
accept or reject that sponsorship.

To prevent circular sponsorships, no agorists in your sponsor tree will be able
to sponsor you.

Unfortunately, because you have been orphaned, all agorists in your sponsor
tree have also  been effectively orphaned.  Depending on the trust links to
your account and their accounts from other agorists, this may result in no
trust link whatsoever between you and other agorists that use Black & Yellow
Pages.

To remedy this as soon as possible, please reach out to agorists outside your
sponsor tree and ask them to sponsor you.  Also, we suggest contacting your
sponsorees and explaining the situation to them.  

Hopefully, we will be contacting you soon with offers to sponsor you!
